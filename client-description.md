# JobHunter - Modular Application Support Plans – Switzerland 🇨🇭

## 🔐 Important Information – Applies to All Plans

✅ **We are *not* a recruitment agency:**  
We solely handle the **administrative work of your job search** – job research, application document creation, submission, and follow-ups.

✅ **100% Discreet – You remain the visible applicant:**  
We act **in your name**, but **are never visible** to employers.  
All applications are sent **as if you wrote them yourself**.
- You review and approve every message and document.
- Employers are **not aware** we are involved.
- There are **no fees** for companies – ever.

✅ **Premium Tools + Human Expertise:**  
We use advanced recruiting software (normally unavailable to individuals) and combine that with **manual search by our team** to find the best opportunities.

✅ **Personal onboarding call & profile setup:**  
Each subscription includes a **30-minute kickoff call** to define your goals and create a personalized candidate profile.

✅ **A dedicated consultant for every client:**  
You’ll be assigned a personal advisor who manages your process and is always available for questions.
